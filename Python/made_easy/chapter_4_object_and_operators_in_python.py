# # Chapter 4: Objects and Operators in Python
#
# ## 4.1. Variables
#
# - Variables in Python are pointers to objects
# - They don't have values themselves, but point to assigned objects
# - Python automatically determines the variable type
#
# Example:
# ```python
# x = 38
# y = "emailid@python.com"
# print(x)  # Outputs: 38
# print(y)  # Outputs: emailid@python.com
# ```
#
# ### 4.1.1. Assignment Operator
#
# - The "=" sign is used to assign values to variables
# - It doesn't mean "equals", but means "assign"
#
# Example:
# ```python
# x = 38  # x - variable name, = - assignment operator, 38 - assigned value
# ```
#
# ### 4.1.2. Variable Names
#
# - Can contain letters, numbers, underscores
# - Must not start with a number
# - Are case-sensitive
# - Cannot match keywords
#
# Example:
# ```python
# valid_name = 10
# Valid_name = 20  # This is a different variable
# # 5fingers = 5  # Not allowed, starts with a number
# # sales data = 100  # Not allowed, contains a space
# ```
#
# ## 4.2. Program Structure
#
# - Programs consist of modules
# - Modules contain expressions
# - Expressions contain operators
# - Operators create and process objects
#
# ## 4.3. Objects
#
# - In Python, all data are objects
# - Objects have a type, value, and associated operations
#
# ### 4.3.1. Object Classification
#
# - Built-in and user-defined
# - Mutable and immutable
#
# Example table from the book:
#
# | Object Type | Object Examples | Mutable or Immutable? |
# |-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
# | Numbers     | 1234, 3.1415, 3+4j | Immutable           |
# | Strings     | 'nilabh', "Bob's" | Immutable            |
# | Lists       | [1, [2, 'three'], 4.5] | Mutable         |
# | Dictionaries| {'food': 'spam', 'taste': 'yum'} | Mutable|
#
# ### 4.3.2. Advantages of Built-in Types
#
# - Simplify programming
# - More efficient than user-defined structures
# - Are a standard part of the language
#
# Example from the book:
# ```python
# # Calculating rectangle area
# Length = 5
# Width = 8
# Area = Length * Width
# print("Area of the Rectangle is", Area)
# print("Perimeter of the rectangle is", 2 * (Length + Width))
# ```
#
# ## 4.4. Standard Type Hierarchy
#
# ### 4.4.1. Built-in Constants
#
# - None: single value, equivalent to False
# - NotImplemented: used in numeric methods
# - Ellipsis: accessed via the ... literal or the Ellipsis name
#
# ### 4.4.2. Numeric Types
#
# - Integers (int): unlimited range
# - Boolean values (bool): subtype of integers, True and False
# - Floating-point numbers (float): double-precision floating-point numbers
# - Complex numbers (complex): pair of floating-point numbers
#
# Example:
# ```python
# x = 2
# y = 3.14
# z = 1 + 2j
# print(
#     type(x), type(y), type(z)
# )  # Outputs: <class 'int'> <class 'float'> <class 'complex'>
# ```
#
# ### 4.4.3. Sequences
#
# Divided into mutable and immutable:
#
# Immutable:
# - Strings (str)
# - Tuples (tuple)
# - Bytes (bytes)
#
# Mutable:
# - Lists (list)
# - Byte arrays (bytearray)
#
# Example:
# ```python
# s = "Hello"
# t = (1, 2, 3)
# l = [1, 2, 3]
# print(s[0], t[1], l[2])  # Outputs: H 2 3
# l[0] = 10  # Allowed for lists
# # s[0] = "h"  # Will raise an error for strings
# ```
#
# ### 4.4.4. Sets
#
# - set: mutable set
# - frozenset: immutable set
#
# Example:
# ```python
# s = {1, 2, 3}
# s.add(4)  # Allowed for set
# fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
# # fs.add(4)  # Will raise an error
# ```
#
# ### 4.4.5. Mappings
#
# - dict: dictionary, mutable key-value mapping
#
# Example:
# ```python
# d = {"brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964}
# print(d["brand"])  # Outputs: Ford
# ```
#
# ## 4.5. Operations with Python Objects
#
# Examples of simple operations:
# ```python
# 14 + 26  # Integer addition
# 1.5 * 4  # Floating-point multiplication
# 2**100  # 2 to the power of 100
# 4 / 2  # Division (always returns float)
# 5 > 4  # Logical expression
# ```
#
# ## 4.6. Operators
#
# ### 4.6.1. Arithmetic operators:
# +, -, *, /, %, //, **
#
# ### 4.6.2. Assignment operators:
# =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
#
# ### 4.6.3. Comparison operators:
# ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
#
# ### 4.6.4. Logical operators:
# and, or, not
#
# ### 4.6.5. Identity and membership operators:
# is, is not, in, not in
#
# ## 4.7. Indentation
#
# - Used to define code blocks
# - Usually 4 spaces are used
#
# Example of correct indentation usage:
# ```python
# if True:
#     print("Hello")
# ```
# Example that raises an error:
# ```python
# if True:
#     print("Hello")  # IndentationError: expected an indented block
# ```
#
# ## 4.8. Comments in Python
#
# - Start with the # symbol
#
# Example:
# ```python
# # This is a comment
# print("Hello")  # This is also a comment
# ```
#
# ## 4.9. Order of Execution
#
# - Determined by operator precedence
# - Can be changed using parentheses
#
# Example of changing execution order with parentheses:
# ```python
# print((2 + 3) * 4)  # Will output 20
# print(2 + 3 * 4)  # Will output 14
# ```
#
# ## 4.10. Dynamic Typing
#
# - Variables can change type during program execution
#
# Example from the book:
# ```python
# six = 6
# print(six)  # Will output: 6
# six = "six"
# print(six)  # Will output: six
# ```
#
# ## 4.11. Strong Typing
#
# - Despite dynamic typing, Python strictly checks types during operations
#
# Example of a type error:
# ```python
# "day" + 1  # Will raise TypeError
# ```
# Correct version:
# ```python
# "day" + str(1)  # Will output: 'day1'
# ```
#
# ## 4.12. Logical and Physical Lines
#
# - Physical line: what is visible in the code
# - Logical line: what Python considers as a single expression
#
# Example with two physical and logical lines:
# ```python
# i = 5
# print(i)
# ```
# Example with one physical but two logical lines:
# ```python
# i = 5
# print(i)
# ```
#
# Additional example from the book (calculating rectangle area):
# ```python
# # calculating rectangle area
# Length = 5
# Width = 8
# Area = Length * Width
# print("Area of the Rectangle is", Area)
# print("Perimeter of the rectangle is", 2 * (Length + Width))
# ```
# Output:
# ```
# Area of the Rectangle is 40
# Perimeter of the rectangle is 26
# ```
#
# This example demonstrates the use of variables, arithmetic operations, and the print() function, and also shows how Python automatically adds spaces when outputting for better readability.

# # 4.14. Exercises
#
# ## 4.14.1. Answer the questions
#
# 1. **What is a variable in Python? How is it different from an object?**
#
#    A variable in Python is a name that refers to an object in memory. It's essentially a pointer or reference. An object, on the other hand, is a piece of data with a type and associated methods. The main difference is that variables are names pointing to objects, while objects are the actual data in memory.
#
# 2. **What are the rules for naming variables in Python? Write which names can be used and which cannot.**
#
#    Rules for variable names in Python:
#    - Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
#    - Must start with a letter or underscore
#    - Are case-sensitive
#    - Cannot be Python keywords
#
#    Valid names: `my_var`, `_count`, `item1`, `camelCase`
#    Invalid names: `2ndVar`, `class`, `for`, `my-var`
#
# 3. **What are the advantages of built-in data types?**
#
#    Advantages of built-in data types:
#    - Simplify programming
#    - More efficient than user-defined structures
#    - Standard across all Python implementations
#    - Optimized for performance
#    - Provide a consistent interface for common operations
#
# 4. **What is an immutable object? Which objects in Python are immutable?**
#
#    An immutable object is one whose state cannot be modified after creation. Immutable objects in Python include:
#    - Numbers (int, float, complex)
#    - Strings
#    - Tuples
#    - Frozen sets
#    - Boolean values
#
# 5. **What is called an object identifier? How is it different from the type?**
#
#    An object identifier is a unique integer representing the object's memory address, obtained using `id()`. The type defines the kind of data the object represents and its available operations. An identifier is unique to each object instance, while many objects can share the same type.
#
# 6. **What do the functions chr() and ord() do? How are they related?**
#
#    `chr()` converts an integer to its corresponding Unicode character. `ord()` converts a Unicode character to its integer code point. They are inverse operations of each other.
#
# 7. **What is an operator? How many types of operators exist in Python? Name them all.**
#
#    An operator is a symbol that tells the interpreter to perform specific operations. Python has six main types of operators:
#    1. Arithmetic operators
#    2. Assignment operators
#    3. Comparison operators
#    4. Logical operators
#    5. Identity operators
#    6. Membership operators
#
# 8. **The operators / and // perform division. What's the difference between them?**
#
#    `/` performs float division, always returning a float result. `//` performs floor division, returning the largest integer not greater than the result (also known as integer division).
#
# 9. **What value do logical operators return?**
#
#    Logical operators return Boolean values: `True` or `False`.
#
# 10. **Why are indentations important in the Python programming language?**
#
#     Indentations in Python define code blocks and structure. They replace curly braces or keywords used in other languages to denote the beginning and end of code blocks.
#
# 11. **How do you write comments in Python? What are they needed for?**
#
#     Comments in Python start with `#`. They are used to explain code, make it more readable, and provide additional information. They are ignored by the Python interpreter.
#
# 12. **How can you change the order of execution of operators in Python?**
#
#     The order of execution in Python can be changed using parentheses, similar to mathematical expressions.
#
# 13. **What's the difference between a logical line and a physical line of code?**
#
#     A physical line is what you see in the code editor. A logical line is what Python interprets as a single statement. Multiple logical lines can be on one physical line using semicolons.
#
# ## 4.14.2. True or False
#
# 1. **Variables in Python receive the value assigned to them.**
#
#    False. Variables in Python refer to objects, they don't receive values directly.
#
# 2. **In Python, you need to define the type of a variable before creating it.**
#
#    False. Python uses dynamic typing, so you don't need to declare variable types.
#
# 3. **The expressions x = 38 and x == 38 do not mean the same thing.**
#
#    True. `x = 38` is an assignment, while `x == 38` is a comparison.
#
# 4. **In Python, we perform operations on objects.**
#
#    True. All data in Python are objects, and operations are performed on these objects.
#
# 5. **Python keywords can be used as variable names.**
#
#    False. Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.
#
# 6. **User-defined data types work more efficiently than built-in ones.**
#
#    False. Built-in data types are generally more efficient as they are optimized at a lower level.
#
# 7. **An object's identifier never changes after its creation.**
#
#    True. The identifier (memory address) of an object remains constant throughout its lifetime.
#
# 8. **Comments make the program more readable and easier to understand.**
#
#    True. Comments help explain code and improve readability.
#
# 9. **Indentations are just decorations and a way to make the program more beautiful and readable.**
#
#    False. In Python, indentations are crucial for defining code structure and blocks.
#
# 10. **The % operator returns the remainder of dividing two numbers.**
#
#     True. The `%` operator is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of division.
