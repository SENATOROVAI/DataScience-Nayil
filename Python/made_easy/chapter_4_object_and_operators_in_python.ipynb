    "# Chapter 4: Objects and Operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1. Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables in Python are pointers to objects\n",
    "- They don't have values themselves, but point to assigned objects\n",
    "- Python automatically determines the variable type\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 38\n",
    "y = \"emailid@python.com\"\n",
    "print(x)  # Outputs: 38\n",
    "print(y)  # Outputs: emailid@python.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.1. Assignment Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"=\" sign is used to assign values to variables\n",
    "- It doesn't mean \"equals\", but means \"assign\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 38  # x - variable name, = - assignment operator, 38 - assigned value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.2. Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can contain letters, numbers, underscores\n",
    "- Must not start with a number\n",
    "- Are case-sensitive\n",
    "- Cannot match keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "valid_name = 10\n",
    "Valid_name = 20  # This is a different variable\n",
    "# 5fingers = 5  # Not allowed, starts with a number\n",
    "# sales data = 100  # Not allowed, contains a space\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2. Program Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programs consist of modules\n",
    "- Modules contain expressions\n",
    "- Expressions contain operators\n",
    "- Operators create and process objects\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3. Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, all data are objects\n",
    "- Objects have a type, value, and associated operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.1. Object Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built-in and user-defined\n",
    "- Mutable and immutable\n",

    "| Dictionaries| {'food': 'spam', 'taste': 'yum'} | Mutable|\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.2. Advantages of Built-in Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplify programming\n",
    "- More efficient than user-defined structures\n",
    "- Are a standard part of the language\n",
    "\n",
    "Example from the book:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculating rectangle area\n",
    "Length = 5\n",
    "Width = 8\n",

    "# 4.14. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.14.1. Answer the questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a variable in Python? How is it different from an object?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   A variable in Python is a name that refers to an object in memory. It's essentially a pointer or reference. An object, on the other hand, is a piece of data with a type and associated methods. The main difference is that variables are names pointing to objects, while objects are the actual data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the rules for naming variables in Python? Write which names can be used and which cannot.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Rules for variable names in Python:\n",
    "   - Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores\n",
    "   - Must start with a letter or underscore\n",
    "   - Are case-sensitive\n",
    "   - Cannot be Python keywords\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Valid names: `my_var`, `_count`, `item1`, `camelCase`\n",
    "   Invalid names: `2ndVar`, `class`, `for`, `my-var`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the advantages of built-in data types?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Advantages of built-in data types:\n",
    "   - Simplify programming\n",
    "   - More efficient than user-defined structures\n",
    "   - Standard across all Python implementations\n",
    "   - Optimized for performance\n",
    "   - Provide a consistent interface for common operations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is an immutable object? Which objects in Python are immutable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   An immutable object is one whose state cannot be modified after creation. Immutable objects in Python include:\n",
    "   - Numbers (int, float, complex)\n",
    "   - Strings\n",
    "   - Tuples\n",
    "   - Frozen sets\n",
    "   - Boolean values\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is called an object identifier? How is it different from the type?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   An object identifier is a unique integer representing the object's memory address, obtained using `id()`. The type defines the kind of data the object represents and its available operations. An identifier is unique to each object instance, while many objects can share the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What do the functions chr() and ord() do? How are they related?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   `chr()` converts an integer to its corresponding Unicode character. `ord()` converts a Unicode character to its integer code point. They are inverse operations of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is an operator? How many types of operators exist in Python? Name them all.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   An operator is a symbol that tells the interpreter to perform specific operations. Python has six main types of operators:\n",
    "   1. Arithmetic operators\n",
    "   2. Assignment operators\n",
    "   3. Comparison operators\n",
    "   4. Logical operators\n",
    "   5. Identity operators\n",
    "   6. Membership operators\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **The operators / and // perform division. What's the difference between them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   `/` performs float division, always returning a float result. `//` performs floor division, returning the largest integer not greater than the result (also known as integer division).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What value do logical operators return?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Logical operators return Boolean values: `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Why are indentations important in the Python programming language?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Indentations in Python define code blocks and structure. They replace curly braces or keywords used in other languages to denote the beginning and end of code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **How do you write comments in Python? What are they needed for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Comments in Python start with `#`. They are used to explain code, make it more readable, and provide additional information. They are ignored by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How can you change the order of execution of operators in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The order of execution in Python can be changed using parentheses, similar to mathematical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What's the difference between a logical line and a physical line of code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A physical line is what you see in the code editor. A logical line is what Python interprets as a single statement. Multiple logical lines can be on one physical line using semicolons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.14.2. True or False\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variables in Python receive the value assigned to them.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   False. Variables in Python refer to objects, they don't receive values directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In Python, you need to define the type of a variable before creating it.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   False. Python uses dynamic typing, so you don't need to declare variable types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The expressions x = 38 and x == 38 do not mean the same thing.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   True. `x = 38` is an assignment, while `x == 38` is a comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **In Python, we perform operations on objects.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   True. All data in Python are objects, and operations are performed on these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Python keywords can be used as variable names.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   False. Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User-defined data types work more efficiently than built-in ones.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   False. Built-in data types are generally more efficient as they are optimized at a lower level.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **An object's identifier never changes after its creation.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   True. The identifier (memory address) of an object remains constant throughout its lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Comments make the program more readable and easier to understand.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   True. Comments help explain code and improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Indentations are just decorations and a way to make the program more beautiful and readable.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   False. In Python, indentations are crucial for defining code structure and blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **The % operator returns the remainder of dividing two numbers.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    True. The `%` operator is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of division."
